If the path consists of nice straight segments then it is relatively straight forward to calculate the line integral in Cartesian coordinates. On the other hand, if the path does not consists of straight segments, then we must employ more advanced technique as we will see here."

    "## D4.2.2 Line Integral of Vector Fields\n",
    "From Calculus I, we have learned how to calculate the integral of a function as it varies with a single variable (in physics, often position $x$ or  time $t$). For the position variable, that implies we are integrating over a straight line segment. For example, the work done by a force $\\vec{F}$ acting on an object that is moving over a displacement $\\Delta \\vec{x} = \\vec{x}_2 - \\vec{x}_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\vec{f}\\cdot d\\vec{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or with the dot product written in geometric form using magnitudes of the vectors and relativive orientation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f\\cos\\theta dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ and $dx$ are the respective magnitudes and $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. What this integral represent is actually a line integral over a vector field for a 1D line segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the line integral is defined as a scaled vector projection of a vector $\\vec{f}$ along some arbitrary path $L$. If an infinitesimal **directional path length** of $L$ is $d\\vec{l}$, then the line integral (or work) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w = \\int_L \\vec{f}\\cdot d\\vec{l} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ simply implies that we are integrating along a path described by $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not familiar with integrating vectors, we can write the dot product out in two ways. First, using the **components** of the two vectors (assuming we are in cartesian coordinates), later, we will go outside the cartesian room and see how big the world really is):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w = \\int_L (f_{x}dx + f_{y}dy + f_{z}dz)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider this a sum of integrals along each cartesian direction and specify the limits of integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f_{x}dx + \\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{2}} f_{y}dy + \\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}} f_{z}dz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We converted our integrals involving vectors into three 1D scalar integrals. Yah for us!\n",
    "* The scalar quantities are the vector components of $\\vec{f}$ and $d\\vec{l}$, respectively, and <b>not</b> the magnitudes. \n",
