    "\n",
    "In the *Introduction to Line Integrals*, we have been so fortunate that our paths were aligned well with the $xy$-directions in a cartesian coordinate system. However, often the world is not as nice and will serve us some humble pie when applying the approach above. For example, what if the path was part of a circle? Already then it appears messy to evaluate the dot product between our force and the line element. This is where **parameterization** comes in and saves us from mathematical humiliation (well, we may still be humiliated but then it is at least because of our own inability to do math). The approach of parameterization is a general approach to solving line integrals (or higher orders such surface and volume integrals as well. \n",

    "This may not seem intuitive and we may just have to take the word of mathematicians on this one. An example is the equation of the unit circle, which can be represented by $g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$. Each point along the path can be represented by some parameter $s$. This implies that we can write our $x$ and $y$ positions in terms of this parameter $s$: $x = x(s)$ and $y = y(s)$. When we are moving some distance $dl$, we will also change $s$ such that we have $ds$ as an infinitesimal change. The position differentials can then be written as (again, review those differentials if you are not confident on this matter):\n",
