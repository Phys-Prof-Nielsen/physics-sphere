It is usually solved through Newton's 2nd law leading to the 2nd order simple harmonic differential equation and found in almost every introductory textbook.

It can also be generated by symbolic mathematical routines, or by the time-honored methods of “guesswork” and “playing around.” Using these methods is as respectable for a physicist as con- sulting a dictionary is for a writer.
