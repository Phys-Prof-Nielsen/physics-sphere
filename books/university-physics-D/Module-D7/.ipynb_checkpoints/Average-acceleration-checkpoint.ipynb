With those terms they are probably speaking of when they were speeding up on the highway: \"we accelerated past that slow car in the outermost lane\", or \"wauw, I had to decelerate so hard due to that slow car in the outermost lane\". In daily languague we tend to associate acceleration with speeding up and deceleration with slowing down.
