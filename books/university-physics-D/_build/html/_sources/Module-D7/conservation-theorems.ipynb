    "## 7.1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservation laws in physics have many practical applications, especially when we consider applications involving collisions. We will here consider two sich conservation laws: conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. Later in Phase B we could consider conservation of energy. \n",

    "$$ \\Delta p_x = f_{net,x}\\Delta t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion from this theorem must be: **if there is no net force acting on the particle, then the momentum transfer is zero: its momentum is conserved**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This consequence is not too interesting for a single particle. However, if we consider a collection of particles, it becomes a lot more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Particle System\n",

    "For a system of particles, only the net external force is capable of changing the system's total momentum. We won't prove that here, but it relates to Newton's 3rd law: action and re-action. This is helpful in colliding systems as the collision forces (which are internal) are often unknown. **If there is no net external force acting on the system, then the total momentum of the system is conserved**. \n",
