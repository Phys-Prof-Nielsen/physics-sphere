    "In Newtonian mechanics force is a concept used to describe interactions between objects and as such, it is a measure of these interactions. Newton found through observations and experiments that <b>an object's motion would change linearly according to the sum of all external interactions</b> on said object. If there was no net external interaction on the object, its motion would remain unchanged. This came to be known as Newton's first law and it can be divided into two parts: one for linear motion and one for rotational motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Phase D, we will only concern ourselves with a <b>constant net external linear interaction</b> on a single point particle (we should know by now what we mean by a point particle). The discussion on identifying individual interactions is an integral part of Newton's laws and will be explored in Phase C, while varying forces will be topic of Phase B when we approach it using calculus. For now we are still restricted to 1D dynamics.\n",
