    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need new tools to expand our capabilities in physics. In this Phase, we will introduce the **line integrals**, **partial derivatives**, and **surface integrals**. Arguably one of the most essential objectives of this course is to explore **Maxwell's Equations**, which is neary impossible to do without at least a minimium level of **multivariable calculus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another objective for introducing them to you is: it is essential that you have a significant understanding of multivariable calculus when you enter the next level of physics. However, being introduced to it in Calculus III often leaves students with just basic application skills but very little conceptual understanding and extensive practice. Hence, the comfort level when entering Modern Physics and Classical Mechanics and/or advanced engineering courses is low and reduces the learning outcome in those classes as focus shift from the physics/science to the mathematical approach. By introducing the concepts and basic application level now, it is my hope that you will gain more from your Calculus III exposure and be fluent in the skills as you enter your next level of physics or engineering.\n",

    "## B1.1.2 Line Integral of Vector Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "From Calculus I, we have learned how to calculate the integral of a function as it varies with a single variable (in physics, often position $x$ or  time $t$). For the position variable, that implies we are integrating over a straight line segment. For example, the work done by a force $\\vec{F}$ acting on an object that is moving over a displacement $\\Delta \\vec{x} = \\vec{x}_2 - \\vec{x}_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or with the dot product written in geometric form using magnitudes of the vectors and relativive orientation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} F\\cos\\theta dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F$ and $dx$ are the respective magnitudes and $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. What this integral represent is actually a line integral over a vector field for a 1D line segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the line integral is defined as a scaled vector projection of a vector $\\vec{F}$ along some arbitrary path $L$. If an infinitesimal **directional path length** of $L$ is $d\\vec{l}$, then the line integral (or work) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_L \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{l} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ simply implies that we are integrating along a path described by $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not familiar with integrating vectors, we can write the dot product out in two ways. First, using the **components** of the two vectors (assuming we are in cartesian coordinates, which just happens to be our choice of place in mpost of Physics I and II. The next level up, Classical Mechanics, we will go outside the cartesian room and see how big the world really is):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_L (F_{x}dx + F_{y}dy + F_{z}dz)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider this a sum of integrals along each cartesian direction and specify the limits of integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} F_{x}dx + \\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{2}} F_{y}dy + \\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}} F_{z}dz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We converted our integrals involving vectors into three 1D scalar integrals, which are familiar with from Calculus I. Yah for us!\n",
    "* The scalar quantities are the vector components of $\\vec{F}$ and $d\\vec{l}$, respectively, and <b>not</b> the magnitudes. \n",
