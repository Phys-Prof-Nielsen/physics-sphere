    "\n",
    "In the previous notes, we encountered integration of more than one variable through line integrals. This time, we will explore derivatives when a function depends on more than one independent variable. For graphical simplicity, we will restrict ourself to two independent variables $x$ and $y$ and consider a function $f(x,y)$. An example of such a function is shown in the figure below where the vertical axis represents \n",

    "Also shown in this plot are the projections onto the $x-f$, $y-f$, and $x-y$ planes, respectively, for a number of cross-sections (not shown). For example, a single profile in the $x-f$ plane represent a cross section of the function in that plane for a given value of $y$ (that is, $y$ =  constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the projection is our familiar single-variable function, and we know how to take the derivative of such a function. Let us consider the projection for $y = 0$:\n",
