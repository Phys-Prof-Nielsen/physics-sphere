We noticed that outside the Earth, the gravitational field looked like as if all the mass of the Earth was at the center: a point mass. Let us try and work through for a uniformly charged sphere and see how the electric field behave. Section 22.4 in your textbook titled **Applications of Gauss's Law** does a few examples that are great to go through.\n",

    "A conductor is characterized by the ability of individual charges to move freely under the influence of a force. Imagine a solid spherical conductor. If a net positive charge is placed on the conductor, each charge will feel a repulsive force from the other charges and will accelerate until an equilibrium is reached. This static equilibrium is reached relatively quick within a time known as the **relaxation time**. The electric force arises due to the electric fields set up by the charges. When the system is in equilibrium, the net electric field must be zero. If it was not zero, charges would accelerate. Hence, **inside a conductor the electric field must be zero**.\n",
