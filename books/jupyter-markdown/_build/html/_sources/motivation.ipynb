    "Jupyter Notebook is an extremely powerful and very useful tool to a scientist for many reasons. My reasons to use it in my classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I firmly believe that as a modern-day scientist, you will need to know some basic programming skills, however, most students are not required to take a course in programming. I want to point out: the courses are not programming classes, and you will not become a programming expert from these notes. Instead, I expose you to how we can use programming in our science courses to our advantage. I strongly encourage you to accept the challenge. I will provide the computer scripts, and at times, ask you to make small modifications to it. I repeat, you are not expected to have prior knowledge of computer coding to perform these exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter allows us to write formatted text, nice looking equations, and executing computer code within the same document, which makes it very suitable for homework, small projects, summaries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embedded in Jupyter is the Python computer language, which is widely used in the scientific communities. With that comes tools for analysis, plotting, and even solving equations symbolically. Way cool!\n",
