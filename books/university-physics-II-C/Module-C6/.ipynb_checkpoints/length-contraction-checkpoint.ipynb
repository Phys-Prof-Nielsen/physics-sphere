    "The majority of secondary particles from cosmic ray interactions are created in an altitude of $\\sim 15$ km above the Earth's surface. However, a fraction is created at altitudes above and below as well. The fact that we can observe these particles at the ground is due to these relativistic effects of time dilation and length contraction. From the muon's perspective, it travels a relative short distance but the atmosphere is also a lot thinner. From the laboratory point of view, the atmosphere is its normal thickness, but the lifetime of the muon is considerably longer and it will therefore travel a greater distance. In both cases, the observed reality is the same :)"
