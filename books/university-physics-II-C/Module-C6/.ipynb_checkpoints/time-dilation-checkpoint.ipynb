    "The time dilation based on special relativity is known as **kinematic time dilation** as it is a consequence of observers moving with respect to each other. The second form is **gravitational time dilation**, which is an effect of space-time curvature (or gravity) with clocks running slower in stronger gravitational fields. If you have watched the movie ``Interstellar'', that is the effect happening on Miller's planet as one hour on Miller's planet is seven years on Earth due to the presence of stronger gravitational pull (or greater space-time curvature) from the black hole, Gargantua.\n",
