    "**Example 1: Person Walking on Train**\n",
    "    \n",
    "A person is standing still on the ground and observe a train passing by at 40.0 mph (it is always a train but at least it is not spherical). Onâ€“board the train a second person is sitting still while a third person is walking in the aisle. The person sitting on the train observes the person walking at a pace 3.00 mph in the same direction as the train is traveling. The person on the ground will observe the person walking at a rate at 43.0 mph. This is our common sense answer and is also the answer we will get if we apply Galilean relativity.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical frame work for Galilean Relativity is the 3D Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ where a point is described by 3 real numbers referred to as the <i>Cartesian coordinates</i>. In terms of linear algebra, our classical laws of physics are formulated within a vector space (more precisely: an inner product space) associated to the 3D Euclidean space and we can define the Euclidean norm which is the length of any vector in this vector space. This allows us to define the Euclidean distance as the length between two points and is equivalent to the magnitude of our displacement vector when thinking about an object being displaced from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Newtonian physics, we are considering interactions (or lack of) acting on objects in both space and time, and we can refer to <b>events</b> to describe our observations. Hence, our events require three position coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$) or a position vector $\\vec{r}$ with respect to a reference frame and a time coordinate $t$ with respect to an observer clock.\n",

    "## C5.1.2 Derivation of Galilean Coordinate Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider to observers ($S$ and $S'$) standing still at the origin in each of their respective reference frames, and let $S'$ travel with a constant velocity of $\\vec{u}$ relative to $S$ (the choice of \"u\" will become evident later). Notice that $\\vec{u}$ is the velocity of $S'$ <i>measured by</i> $S$. An event in $S$ will be described by $(\\vec{r},t)$ while the same event in $S'$ is described by $(\\vec{r}',t')$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this derivation, we will simplify the approach to focus on the important physics, but realize that in a practical situation there may be additional factors we must take into account (as we make our simplifications, we will know what those are).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We consider a single event: the measurement of the position of a point $P$.\n",
    "* The coordinate systems $S$ and $S'$ are aligned such that they have common $x$, $y$, and $z$-axes. (If there were not aligned, they could be aligned through rotations about the principal axes).\n",
    "* We only consider linear motion and let $S'$ travel with a constant velocity $\\vec{u}$ in the positive $x$-direction relative to $S$.\n",
    "* When the two observers (or origins) pass each other ($x = x' = 0$) they synchronize their clock's such that $t_0 = t'_0 =0$ at that instant.\n",
    "                \n",
    "The majority of the above simplifications/assumptions are simply removing constant off-sets from our analysis. For example, if the clocks are not synchronized, the two time measurements $t$ and $t'$ would not be the same. Say, an observer in California makes an observation of a point $P$ in Utah, while an Utah-based observer makes the same observation at the same instant. Their times would be off by 2 hour due to the time zones. It would not be an issue for the two observers to agree on the time when the off-set was taken into account. Similarly, synchronizing the clocks when the two origins coincide removes a spatial position off-set. Make sure you understand how these assumptions impacts our analysis. Now, on to the important stuff. The figure below illustrates the setup we are working with.\n",

    "<img src=\"C5-fig1.1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Observer $S$ is going to measure a position vector $\\vec{x}_S$ at $t$, while observer $S'$ is measuring a position vector $\\vec{x}'_{S'}$ at $t'$. Depending on the time of measurements, the two observers are separated in distance. In fact, observer $S$ is going to see observe $S'$ move away a displacement of $\\vec{u}t$. The figure below sketch these displacements onto the sketch from above\n",

Let $S$ travel with a constant velocity $-\\vec{u}$ with respect to $S'$. For simplicity we will assume the two observers synchronize their clock's such that when they pass each other they set $t_0 = t'_0 =0$. The above sketch shows the scenario. Following the same approach as we did earlier, complete the following:\n",

    "1. We recognize that the transformation equations (1) and Box 2 part (4) are of same form with $S$ and $S'$ switched and substituting the relative velocity $\\vec{u}$ with $-\\vec{u}$. This is a consequence of the principle of relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the point $P$ was not restricted along the $x$-axis but had non-zero $y$- and $z$-components, we would have $y = y'$ and $z = z'$ since the relative motion was restricted to 1D motion of the $S'$ frame relative to $S$. **The transformation only affects coordinates in the direction of relative velocity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If we did not restrict ourselves to 1D relative motion, but allowed relative motion in 3D, we could break the analysis into three identical analyses in $x$, $y$, and $z$ just as we did above to obtain similar answers for the respective directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. We actually have two events required here in order to transform the coordinate between the two observers. Since the displacement between the two observers depend on the **elapsed time** between the time of common origin **and** the time of observation of the point $P$. The time $t$ in the equation is actually $\\Delta t = t - t_0$, but we conveniently synchronized the clocks at $t = t' = 0$ such that $t_0 = 0$.\n",

If 10 seconds elapsed on your clock, I will assume 10 seconds elapsed on my clock as well (provided that both clocks are in good working conditions, of course ;) . Hence, we assume that $\\Delta t = \\Delta t'$. This is where Galilean relativity goes wrong and is corrected with special relativity.\n",
