    "The time dilation based on special relativity is known as **kinematic time dilation** as it is a consequence of observers moving with respect to each other. The second form is **gravitational time dilation**, which is an effect of space-time curvature (or gravity) with clocks running slower in stronger gravitational fields. If you have watched the movie \"Interstellar\", that is the effect happening on Miller's planet as one hour on Miller's planet is seven years on Earth due to the presence of stronger gravitational pull (or greater space-time curvature) from the black hole, Gargantua.\n",
