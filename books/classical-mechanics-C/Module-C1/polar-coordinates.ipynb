    "We know how torelate **linear tangential** parameters to **rotational** parameters for **circular** motion. However, we also need to know radial parameters to fully describe rotational motion, and for that purpose we need the full treatment using polar coordinates. As an example, anytime we have circular motion, a radial force is required to change the direction of the object, otherwise it just moves in a straight line. \n",
