    "## Point Charge\n",
    "Just as the point mass is hypothetical and used to introduce concepts of force etc. in Physics 2210, we define the **point charge** $q$. While a point charge is hypotehtical, our closest object to a point charge is the electron. We have yet to determine the size of it but there is an upper bound of $\\sim 10^{-18}$ m. For our current purposes, we will consider particles such as electrons and protons as point charges. Later in the semester, we will see that the proton can indeed be broken into smaller charge particles known as quarks.\n",
