    "I know that we have not discussed the electric force yet, but we are probably aware that like charges repel and unlike charges attrack due to some sort of electrical interaction. This interaction is the electric force. Many metals such as copper, aluminum, gold, and silver are good conductors, and the reason they are used in wires. Conductors do not have to be metals. For example, water is a conductor as well. In biological systems, charges are often carried by ions such as *Na$^+$* and *K$^+$*, which are suspended in an aqueous solution.\n",

    "This is the mechanism most people are familiar with. Examples are: rubbing a rod with animal fur, rubbing balloon against your hair or sweater, and walking across carpet. Charge by friction occurs when two objects are rubbed against each other and one object (the electron acceptor) has a greater electron affinity than the other (the electron donor). \n",

    "#### Pollination by Charge\n",
    "As bumble bees flies through the air, the air drag is causing charging by friction. This happens to be a quite clever design as the pollen carries a slight opposite charge to the bees. Hence, the pollen will attach itself to the bees through electrical interaction due to the opposite charges.

    "### Charge by Induction: Method 1\n",
    "Consider two neutral, conducting objects that are in contact with each other. Since they are in contact, all charges are even distributed across the combined surcface. If a third object with a net charge is placed in close proximity to the two objects, it will cause the charges on the two objects to re-distribut themselves due to the net interaction occurring. While the third object is close, the first two objects are separated, and the third object is then removed. This process leaves the two original objects with opposite net charges.\n",

The first object is then grounded (connected to another object which is capable of accepting charges, for example, the Earth is capable of accepting a lot of charge from an object). While the second object is still in close proximity, the ground connection is removed, and the second object is then removed as well. This process leaves the main object with a net charge.\n",

    "This process is not causing an object to have a net charge, but does cause the object to be able to interact through electrical forces. In most atoms and molecules the center of the positive charge coincides with the center of negative charge: think of the electron structure around a nuclei. However, it is possible in some cases to distort this configuration slightly in the presence of a charged object. The result is one \"side\" of the molecule is an opposite charge in comparison to the other \"side\". This realignment can occur on insulators and is known as polarization. Below are a few examples of this phenomenon.\n",
