    "It would have been convenient of the magnetic field had the same origin and similar behavior as the electric field. Unfortunately that is not the case as magnetic field appears significantly more complex than the electric field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic fields were arguable discovered before electric fields and applications such as compasses and permanent magnets were used well before the enlightment period and beginning of modern science. The true nature of magnetic fields was revealed with the development of special relativity. One may notice that physics as of today is explained through four field theories: gravity, electric, weak, and strong. There is no magnetic field theory. In turns out that **magnetic fields are relativistic electric fields due to charges in motion**. Pretty f...... awesome. \n",
