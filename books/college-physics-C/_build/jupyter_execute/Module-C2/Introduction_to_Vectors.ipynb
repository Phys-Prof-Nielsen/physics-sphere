    "Ok, if you want a little bit of the truth: a vector can be characterized as either <i>covariant</i> or <i>contravariant</i> depending on how it transforms under a coordinate transform from one coordinate basis to another. This is some hot stuff and typically covered in a course such as <i>differential geometry</i>. The issue is not important when dealing with rectangular coordinate systems such as our standard cartesian $xyz$-system (there is no distinction between covariant and contravariant components), but becomes essential in non-orthogonal coordinate transformations (for example: spherical). Fields such as quantum mechanics and general relatively, and even advanced classical Newtonian mechanics, will need an understanding of these concepts.\n",

    "There are physical quantities that are not scalars nor vectors, but instead belong to a higher order of geometric objects (really difficult to visualize). In fact, a scalar is a 0th rank tensor, a vector is a tensor of rank 1. As we proceed to higher orders, we do not have special words for the tensors and simply refer to them as tensors of rank 2, 3, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will not directly use tensors in our course, and you will have to wait until more advanced physics courses to fully experience tensors (but then I am sure you will be really excited as the cool-factor is off the chart!). However, we will consider components of a few tensors, which in our cases reduce to scalar quantities. Examples of tensors are\n",
