    "In principle we do not need any more tools to fully solve a problem within the work-energy regime. However, work deals with force and displacement, which both are vectors and adds some complexity as need to consider respective directions. It turns out that vector calculus tells us that under certain conditions, some forces can be written in terms of a scalar function, which we call the **potential energy**. The forces associated with potential energies are called **conservative forces**. By introducing the potential energy concept, we can solve many problems using work-energy without having to deal with vectors.\n",

    "The above statement then also define a **non-conservative force** as a force whose work depends on the path taken. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "In moving an object from position A to some other position(s) and back to A, the work done by a conservative force is zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two most common conservative forces are the forces of gravity and linear spring.\n",

While we can not definitively prove a force is conservative, we can test the premise by calculating the work done along a closed path. If the work is zero, it **may** be a conservative force. If it is not zero, we can conclude that it is not conservative. \n",
