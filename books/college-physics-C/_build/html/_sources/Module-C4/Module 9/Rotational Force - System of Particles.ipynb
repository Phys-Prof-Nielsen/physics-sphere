    "One may think that extending the discussion from the linear case to the rotational case is straightforward, however, that is not the case. The reason why is beyond this class and covered in *Classical Mechanics*. The textbook attempts with a short paragraph to explain why only external torque is important for the dynamics of a system but it fails on the fundamental level as it requires a field theory approach. Instead, we will go ahead a list the result without the in-depth analysis.\n",
