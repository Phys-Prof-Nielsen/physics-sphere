    "The <span style=\"color:red\">dot product</span> is one of two vector operations aside from the arithmetic operations we have seen so far that we will use in PHYS2210.

    "\n",
    "The dot product is a very important operation in physics. For example, one of the most important concepts in Newtonian physics is the <i>mechanical work</i> or <i>energy transfer</i> by a force acting over a distance. This quantity is defined mathematically through a dot product.\n",

    "## C2.10.3 Interpretation\n",
    "The dot product is for most students relatively straightforward to calculate. However, the interpretation or its meaning is often missed in the process, or happily forgotten as it may not be important for the exam. Well, welcome to Doc Nielsen's class where concept and understanding is a priority &#129299;\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try and explain it in two ways: a more mathematical form using geometric representation, and a word example using physics. I hope they together will provide you with a conceptual understanding of the dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1\n",
    "First, let us consider the definition of the dot product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{A}|~|\\vec{B}|~\\cos\\theta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "but now let us put some parantheses around part of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{A}|~\\left(|\\vec{B}|~\\cos\\theta \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From a trigonometric point of view, the value in the parantheses is the <span style=\"color:red\">projection of vector $\\vec{B}$ onto the line of $\\vec{A}$</span> as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C2-fig14.png\"  width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is this projection multiplied by the lenght of vector $\\vec{A}$. We can therefore interpretate the dot product as: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "The dot project is a scaled projection or a measure of how much overlap there is between two vectors.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also have grouped the factors in the definition equation as (remember, the order of multiplication does not matter):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{B}|~\\left(|\\vec{A}|~\\cos\\theta \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From a trigonometric point of view, the value in the parantheses is now the <span style=\"color:red\">projection of vector $\\vec{A}$ onto the line of $\\vec{B}$</span> as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C2-fig15.png\"  width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, these two result in the same number as it is the same equation, however, we can make the following observation: the projection of $\\vec{B}$ onto the line of $\\vec{A}$ is less than the projection of $\\vec{A}$ onto the line of $\\vec{B}$, but the scaling is larger in the former case than in the later case, resulting in exactly the same number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2\n",
    "The work done by a mechanical force on an object is the dot product between the force acting on the object and the displacement of the object of which the force is acting over. Work is also a measure of energy transfer, in layman's term we may say how much effort is done by the applied force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are pushing a box across a horizontal floor, but we are applying a force at an angle with respect to the horizontal. The dot product between the force and the displacement is a measure of the overlap between the two vectors: or how much effort is put into the horizontal displacement of the box by the force. We can imagine two scenarios: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) a person supplying a larger force applied over a shorter distance or (2) a person supplying a smaller force applied over a larger distance, both can have put equal amount of effort (or transferred the same amount of energy) into moving the box. These scenarios are equivalent to the projection of vectors onto each other as in the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: when we in daily life say something like: \"it takes a lot of effort\", we are actually referring to that it requires a lot of energy transfer &#129299;\n",
