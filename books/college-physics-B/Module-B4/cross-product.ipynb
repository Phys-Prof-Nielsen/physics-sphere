    "The **cross product** is the second vector product we encounter in introductory physics. The cross product is a lot more complex than the dot product for various reasons that we will not discuss in this course. If you are interested in learning much more about the cross product, you will need to take courses in abstract algebra as well as differential geometry. In our course, we will restrict ourselves to learn how to calculate the cross product using both a geometric and an analytic approach, similar to our discussion on the dot product.\n",

    "The torque acting on an object by an applied force depends on the force and where the force is applied. For example, if you want to open a door, it is a lot easier to open it if you push on the opposite side of the hinges and push perpendicular to the door. Similarly, if you use a wrench to losen a nut, you should hold the wrench at the end opposite to the nut and apply a force perpendicular to the handle of the wrench. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, the distance from the hinges to the place on the door where you apply the force, and the distance from the nut to where you apply the force on the wrench, is called the **moment arm** or the **lever arm**.\n",
