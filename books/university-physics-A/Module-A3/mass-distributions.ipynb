    "To know the gravitaional interaction between objects, we will need to know the gravitational field $\\vec{g}$ at the location of an object subject to the field. In many cases, the source objects are spherical systems but there may be times where they are not. In those cases, we will need a tool to determine the gravitational field based on the given mass distribution. There are two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the gravitional field from a point mass as obtained from Newton's law of gravity and integrate over the distribution. This is a general approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply Gauss's for gravity. This approach is only quantitatively usefull under certain distributions.\n",
