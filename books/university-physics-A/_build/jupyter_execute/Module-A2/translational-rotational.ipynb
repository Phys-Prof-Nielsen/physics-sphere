    "We may also have noticed that we se the **exact** same relationship for the **linear speed of the center of mass**, despite that fact that the center of mass is not located at the edge. Shouldn't we be using $r = 0$ in that case? The answer is no and may not be intuitive, and these notes are to aid some understanding on that puzzle.\n",
