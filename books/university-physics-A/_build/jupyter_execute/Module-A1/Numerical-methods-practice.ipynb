    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy A: Equation 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the derivative in the equation presented.\n",
    "2. Isolate the derivative on one side of the equation.\n",
    "3. Replace the derivative: $ \\frac{df}{dt} \\rightarrow \\frac{f_{i+1} - f_i}{\\Delta t} $ according to Equation (1).\n",
    "4. On the other side of the equation, attach subscripts {i} on all the variables. We should know these values at some initial time (does not have to be zero).\n",
    "5. Solve the algebraic equation for $f_{i+1}$. This is our **iterative equation**.\n",
    "6. Choose a time step $\\Delta t$. If solving on paper, choose $\\Delta t = 1$ unless otherwise stated. If using a computer to solve the numerical problem, we can choose a smaller step size. The rule of thumb is: <b>the function we are evaluating can not change considerably over one time step. If it does, we may expect large errors in the approximation</b>.\n",
    "7. Use the initial condition $(t_0, f_0)$ to calculate $(t_1,f_1)$ with $t_1 = t_0 + \\Delta t$.\n",
    "8. Repeat step 7 as many times as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy B: Equation 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the instantaneous slope given.\n",
    "2. Insert the instantaneous slope into Equation (2). This is our **iterative equation**.\n",
    "3. Choose a time step $\\Delta t$. If solving on paper, choose $\\Delta t = 1$ unless otherwise stated. If using a computer to solve the numerical problem, we can choose a smaller step size. The rule of thumb is: <b>the function we are evaluating can not change considerably over one time step. If it does, we may expect large errors in the approximation</b>.\n",
    "4. Use the initial condition $(t_0, f_0)$ to calculate $(t_1,f_1)$ with $t_1 = t_0 + \\Delta t$.\n",

    "$$ \\frac{v_{i+1} - v_{i}}{\\Delta t} = vt + 1 $$\n",

    "#### Step 7\n",
    "Our initial condition is $(t_0, f_0) = (0, 1)$. Inserting into our iterative equation, we get:\n",
