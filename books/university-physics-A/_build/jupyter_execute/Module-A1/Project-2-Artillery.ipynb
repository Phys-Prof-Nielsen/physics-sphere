    "3. One thing we notice from addressing objectives (1) and (2), is the high altitude the shell is reaching. One may therefore consider potential effects of atmospheric density on the frictional force. The atmospheric density can be modeled by the adiabatic approximation $ \\rho = \\rho_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{ay}{T_0} \\right)^\\alpha $ Here $\\rho_0$ is the air density at sea level, $a = 6.5 \\times 10^{âˆ’3}$ K/m is the adiabatic lapse rate, $T_0$ is the temperature at sea level (pick an appropriate value), and $\\alpha = 2.5$ for air. The modified drag acceleration then becomes a function of altitude (or y): $ a_{drag} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}a_{drag_0} $ where $a_{drag_0}$ is the original drag acceleration at sea level. Repeat the activity with the modified air drag.\n",
