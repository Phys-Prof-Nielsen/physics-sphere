    "While these examples are great at illustrating important concepts, they fail\n",
    "in providing accurate prediction for real-life examples. When these\n",
    "assumptions are not valid, our problems often become too difficult to obtain\n",
    "exact solutions for, and our best effort is to provide approximate solutions\n",
    "that are correct to within a set acceptable error margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, Newton's second law is a second order differential equation, which in many real-life applications is non-linear and only solveable through numerical methods. Under certain situations, we can transform it into coupled first order differential equations that can be solved by numerical integration methods. The objective of this note is to obtain these numerical integration schemes known as **finite difference methods**. \n",

That is actually pretty cool!\n",

We will get practice using this approach and by the end of the semester, I hope we have a much better appreciation for it.\n",

    "As a final note: the approach above is the **first order forward finite difference method**. We could also work backwards with the Taylor expansion to obtain the **backward finite difference method**. This method is used when we need to gain information about points prior to our known data point. Finally, we can combine the two and obtain the **central finite difference method**, which differ by having an order of magnitude smaller error. We will not be employing either of the two, but if you are curious, check out \n",
