    "The trajectory of the molecule(s) can be parameterized by x- and y-positions (with y being our vertical direction) in a xy-plane, while these positions are dictated through accelerations and velocites. Obviously, we have the acceleration of gravity acting on the molecule(s) in the vertical direction, but we will go one step futher and include the acceleration due to air drag after the molecule(s) leave the host. \n",

The speed of the particle is $v$, $C_D$ is a drag coefficient that depends on the shape of the object ($0.47$ for a sphere), $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object as it moves through the gas/fluid, and $m$ is the mass of the object. \n",
