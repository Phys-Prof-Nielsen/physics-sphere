    "Calculate the impulse of a car (assuming it is a point particle for now) with a mass of $2000.0$ kg and initial speed $30.0$ m/s in the positive $x$-direction. At a later time, the speed of the car is $10.0$ m/s in the positive $x$-direction. Find its impulse (or change in motion).\n",

    "\n",

    "Later, we will introduce concepts of acceleration and force, and how they relate to impulse. Here, the impulse (or change in momentum) is caused by an interaction (force), which is in the same direction as the impulse. This is causing an acceleration in the the opposite direction of motion and causing the car to slow down in that direction.\n",
