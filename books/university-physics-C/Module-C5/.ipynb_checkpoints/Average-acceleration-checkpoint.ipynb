With those terms they are probably speaking of when they were speeding up on the highway: \"we accelerated past that slow car in the outermost lane\", or \"wauw, I had to decelerate so hard due to that slow car in the outermost lane\". In daily languague we tend to associate acceleration with speeding up and deceleration with slowing down. However, this can lead to faulty conclusions in physics since directions are not taken into account.\n",
