    "Before we go on to dicuss Newton's Laws and how we apply them using knowledge of individual forces or interactions, I find it is to be suitable to provide a survey of how we actually understand the world of today. Newton's view is appropriate for a wide range of everyday phenomena, but we also know that it is not how naure works on its most fundamental levels.\n",

    "Newton formulated his theories (better word than laws) based on observations and they constitute what is known as **Newtonian Mechanics**. The focus of Newtonian mechanics is in identifying the forces (or interactions) that interacts with an object and less on the object itself.  \n",

    "## Strong\n",
    "The strong interaction is described through **Quantum Chromo Dynamics** or **QCD**. This interaction is called strong since it is significantly stronger than the other field interactions on short scales. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the smallest scale, the strong interaction is responsible for holding, or gluing, quarks together to form hadrons such as protons and neutrons, baryons, and mesons. An interesting fact is that the mass of these particles are mostly energy in form of the binding energy between the interacting quarks, and we say that the field energy is what makes up 99$\\%$ of the mass of protons and neutrons. This is a great example of $E = mc^2$, which shows that energy and mass are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its strong nature, the interaction between quarks can be felt between individual hadrons as well. That is, one hadron can interact with another hadron and this is known as the **residual strong force or nuclear force**. This interaction binds hadrons together on scales comparable to neighboring hadrons whereas the electric interaction will dominate on larger scale. This explains why, for example, a helium nuclei is stable. Since a helium nuclei contains two protons and two neutrons, one may expect the eletric repulsive interaction to push the protons apart. However, the strong interaction owerpowers the electric repulsion and holds the protons and neutrons together to form a stable nuclei. This process holds for nuclei up to bismuth with 83 protons and 126 neutrons. As the nuclei gets larger, more and more neutrons are required to hold it together until the size of the nuclei is such that the electric interaction repels the protons apart and we have an unstable nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short-scale strong field interacts with particle with **color charge** (red, green, blue and anti red, green, blue). The great Richard Feynman called his colleagues for idiot physicists for providing this labeling. The virtual particles are the **gluons**.\n",

    "The residual force acts on *left-over color* or the hadron/baryon/meson particles, while the messenger (or virtual particle) is the $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ mesons.\n",

    "## General Relativity\n",
    "On very large scale, general relativity tells us that gravity as we know it, and as described through Newton's law of gravity, is not a real interaction but instead a manifestation of space-time curvature. In this theory, mass and energy dictates how space-time curves and space-time curvature dictates how matter moves. Just as with the quantum field theories, the principle is derived from the Lagrangian and Hamilton's Principle. This leads to the **Geodesic Equation**, which provides us with a set of differential equations with solutions that parameterizes the path of a particle or photon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input into the geodesic equation is a metric tensor describing a metric for a given coordinate system. For example, in a flat 2D Euclidean space, the metric is simply $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$, and the solution to the geodesic equation is a straight line. In fact, all Euclidean spaces are flat space whereas Minkowski space is a flat space-time. Special relativity is general relativity in flat space-time. When the space-time is curved, we consider a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In flat space-time,two observers at rest relative to each other will measure the same elapsed time whereas two observers moving with respect to each other will measure two different elapsed times (time dilation). In curved space-time, the two observers at rest will not measure the same elapsed time if one or the other is near a massive object, unless they are at the same position infinitely far away from the massive object. Hence, there are time dilations due to relative motion **and due to massive objects**. We actually experience this in everyday life through GPS systems as signals from GPS satellites are subject to time dilation from relative motion, but also due to space-time curvature of the Earth.\n",
