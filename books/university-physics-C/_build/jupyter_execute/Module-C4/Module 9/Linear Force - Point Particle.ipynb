    "In Newtonian mechanics, force is a concept used to describe interactions between objects and as such, it is a measure of these interactions. Newton found through observations and experiments that an objects motion would change linearly according to the sum of all interactions on said object. If there were not net interaction on the object, its motion would remain unchanged. This came to be known as Newton's first law and it can be divided into two parts: one for linear motion and one for rotational motion.\n",
