    "## C2.5.1 Motivation\n",
    "The most usage of addition/subtraction of vectors comes when we work with Newton's second law as it relateds a sum of vectors (forces) to the acceleration of an object. Fortunately, the skills we developed in PHASE D where we dealt with objects with direction (e.g. $v_x$). In fact, in 2D and 3D, we will break the problem down to 1D cases for each Cartesian coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard rules for number arithmetic that we are familiar with from elementary school applies to the <b>vector components</b> as well since each component is treated as a scalar: A 3D vector equation represents three scalar equations. In other words, we have separate scalar equations for the x, y, and z-components. We will go through this by using illustrative examples.\n",
