    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an extremely powerful and very useful tool to a scientist for many reasons. My reasons to use it in my classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I firmly believe that as a modern-day scientist, you will need to know some basic programming skills, however, most students are not required to take a course in programming. I want to point out: the courses are not programming classes, and you will not become a programming expert from these notes. Instead, I expose you to how we can use programming in our science courses to our advantage. I strongly encourage you to accept the challenge. I will provide the computer scripts, and at times, ask you to make small modifications to it. I repeat, you are not expected to have prior knowledge of computer coding to perform these exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter allows us to write formatted text, nice looking equations, and executing computer code within the same document, which makes it very suitable for homework, small projects, summaries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embedded in Jupyter is the Python computer language, which is widely used in the scientific communities. With that comes tools for analysis, plotting, and even solving equations symbolically. Way cool!\n",

    "## 1.2 Using Jupyter for Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "The default compiler used in Jupyter is a Python compiler. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stand-alone\n",
    "\n",
    "While [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) can be deployed directly from a web browser, I strongly recommend you install it on your computer if you are serious about learning it. The version I recommend to install comes as part of a scientific software package called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), and it has all the python packages included that we will be using in our courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an app to run Jupyter on iOS too called [Carnet](https://holzschu.github.io/Carnets_Jupyter/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this compendium, I will use the following option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedded in the Physics Sphere Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes you are reading are created using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). There are many advantages to using Jupyter book when dealing with many notebooks aside from organization. One of them is the ability to make the code cells **interactive** in the browser using the **Thebe Project**. In your e-books/notes you will see a small rocket ship in the top navigation bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "The small rocket ship in the navigation bar can be used to make all the code cells in your e-books/notes interactive and allow you to run/edit Python programs within the e-book/note. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature can be a great help in doing homework, test problems, etc., but I also hope it will encourage you to sit down and take a moment to analyze the code, understand what it is doing, and maybe inspire you to utilize it on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try a simple examle here. In the box below you find a simple multiplication calculator. I have programmed two numbers by default. Try and use the rocket ship button, run the program and then edit it to multiply other numbers."
