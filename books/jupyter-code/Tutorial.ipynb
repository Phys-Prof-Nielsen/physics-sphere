    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Early exposure to computer programming is becoming increasingly vital for the core science education and future careers. As the complexity of physical systems grows and analytical solutions become less practical, computational methods have emerged as a powerful tool for problem-solving. Introducing students to programming early allows them to approach physics problems with greater flexibility, enabling them to tackle complex equations, simulate real-world scenarios, and analyze large datasets. This skill helps bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, fostering a more comprehensive grasp of the subject. Additionally, programming provides students with immediate feedback, encouraging iterative learning and deeper exploration of physics concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an employment perspective, proficiency in programming opens a wide range of career opportunities for science graduates. Today, many industries such as data science, engineering, finance, and technology demand employees who are not only strong in their core discipline but also adept in computational skills. Whether developing algorithms, modeling physical phenomena, or automating processes, the ability to code is often a prerequisite for these roles. By learning to code alongside physics, students acquire a competitive edge in the job market, ensuring they are equipped to handle the demands of modern scientific and technical careers. Many employers look for candidates who can efficiently work with software tools, write custom programs, and leverage data to solve problems that are cultivated through early exposure to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, computer programming fosters transferable skills like logical thinking, problem decomposition, and algorithmic design, which are highly sought after across various fields. Even for students who may not pursue a career directly related to physics, programming is a versatile tool that enhances their employability in a technology-driven world. As industries continue to adopt automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, the demand for professionals who can understand and apply computational techniques will only grow. Thus, integrating programming into the early physics curriculum not only enriches the learning experience but also prepares students for the future job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is my own experience that students who embrace the computer as a tool strongly improve the methodological approach to problem solving and thus better at solving more complex problems encountered in university physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an opportunity to use the computer to solve physics problems in a guided approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is a great programming language to learn. It is relatively easy to learn basic skills but it is incredible powerful for more in-depth programming. The basic Python compiler is not that helpful for us to solve physics problems, however, additional packages exists that are developed for scientific analysis in mind.\n",

Both packages contains functions of same names, and the last called package will override those functions from the first package. Unfortunately, they don't necessarily work the same way. Hence, you may think you are using the cosine function from numpy but are really using the cosine function from math and end up not getting the answer you want.\n",
