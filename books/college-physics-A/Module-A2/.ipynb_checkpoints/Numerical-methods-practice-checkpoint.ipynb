    "(for example through integration). Some examples are scenarios where acceleration (and/or velocity) is time and/or\n",
    "position dependent and we want to know something about velocity (and/or position). Other examples occur when\n",
    "we include frictional interactions in Netwon's Laws, which in many cases we are left with problems that require numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have explored one numerical integration method: the **forward finite difference method**. This method may be applicable when we are dealing with a first-order differential equation. In this case, the **instantaneous slope** (or derivative) is approximated through finite differences. Often our variable of interest $f$ is a function of time $t$. Examples are velocity and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, we must have a known **starting data point** and a **model of the instantaneous slope**. We can then made successive linear approximations to obtain the answer at a given time (or position) by using the following **iterative equation**: \n",

    "where the index $i$ is a notation indicating that we have knowledge of the function values at some time $t_i$ while the next \"step\" $t_{i+1}$ is unknown but is what we want to solve for. This method is an iterative approach and is one example of a numerical integration. **It requires an initial data point $(t_i,f_i(t_i)$ to start the iterative process**.\n",

    "1. Identify the instantaneous slope given.\n",
    "2. Insert the instantaneous slope into Equation (1). This is our **iterative equation**.\n",
    "3. Choose a time step $\\Delta t$. If solving on paper, choose $\\Delta t = 1$ unless otherwise stated. If using a computer to solve the numerical problem, we can choose a smaller step size. The rule of thumb is: <b>the function we are evaluating can not change considerably over one time step. If it does, we may expect large errors in the approximation</b>.\n",
