    "We saw in previous phase how we can relate **linear tangential** parameters to **rotational** parameters for **circular** motion. However, we also need to know radial parameters to fully describe rotational motion, and for that purpose we need the full treatment using polar coordinates. As an example, anytime we have circular motion, a radial force is required to change the direction of the object, otherwise it just moves in a straight line. \n",

    "The blue vector represents a position vector $\\vec{r}$. The two red vectors are the cartesian unit vectors $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$, while the green vectors are the polar unit vectors $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$. In contrast to the cartesian unit vectors, the polar unit vectors are changing directions depending on the position vector. The radial unit vector $\\hat{r}$ is always pointing in the radial direction away from the origin, and the angular unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ is always pointing in the counterclockwise angular direction.\n",
