    "Angular momentum, or rotational momentum, is the measure of rotational motion just as linear momentum is the measure of linear motion. We will first define angular momentum in a similar fashion as the linear counterpart, but we will quickly realize that the angular momentum is a beast compared to linear momemtum. We will make certain assumptions that will restrict its complexity and hopefully help us gain some confidence in those simpler scenarios. For a more rigorous discussion, you will need to take the course on classical mechanics.\n",
