    "## B8.1.1 Short Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previosly introduced the concept of mass and seen a few ways to define it such as a resistance to a **change in linear motion** (Newtonian definition) or amount of matter in a substance (more of a common sense approach). However, none of them are correct on the most fundamental level, where it is more a question of field interactions and it is still something we have difficulties explaining. One fact for sure: **mass is an intrinsic property of field interactions and can be associated with any particles not traveling at the speed of light**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moment of inertia on the other hand, is **not an intrinsic property of matter** but depends both on mass and reference frame of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to calculating the moment of inertia is significantly more complicated than many other physical parameters and an in-depth analysis of it is beyond the scope of this class. Instead, it is an award given to students who take the course **Classical Mechanics**. In the following, I will re-iterate what the textbook tells you, but also try and formulate it slightly different or approach it differently, and even briefly introduce the more complicated moment of inertia out of my deep love and concern for the students majoring in physics and mechanical engineering.\n",

    "By linear motion we imply straight-line motion or motion that can be divided into straight-line segments. In principle, an object traveling in a circle can be approximated as a large number of small straight-line segments, with the circular motion obtained when the number goes to infinity. Later on, we will refer to this as the **orbital** motion. An object can also undergo rotational motion without any straight-line segments, that can happen when an uniform object is spinning around an axis through its center (it is a lot more complicated than it sounds, and we will see why later). We will refer to this kind of rotational motion as **intrinsic** motion.  "

    "1. The typical rating is: beach ball, tennis ball, golf ball, and baseball. The ranking between the tennis ball and golf ball is the most difficult to assess since their masses and sizes are comparable. How do you determine it? Well, you may notice that with the tennis ball in one hand and the golf ball in the other hand, you start moving your hands up and down (in a linear fashion). Why? You are trying to assess their <b>resistance to a change in motion</b>. You are literally assessing the definition that Newton established for inertial mass. Where does the size come in? The size matter through pressure. We are not capable of sensing mass on our hand. Instead, there is an interaction (or force) acting on our hand. That force over the interaction area is known as pressure, and it is the pressure we are sensing. Since the golf ball has smaller contact area, we will sense it to be slightly more massive than the tennis ball. This observation is really emphasized by the beach ball, which is the most massive of all the objects, but since it has a large contact area, it is the object that exert the least amount of pressure and we sense that as being the least massive object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moment of inertia is the resistance to a change in rotational motion and depends both on mass and the location of the mass with respect to an axis of rotation (in this case, an axis that is perpendicular to the plane of rotation and through your elbow or wrist depending on you how rotated it). The further away the mass is from this axis, the greater the moment of inertia and the greater resistance to a change in rotational motion. Could you feel that? You can also try and just hold the stick at rest horizontally. You will need to apply a greater force to prevent it from \"falling\" down if the mass is further away as compared to when it is close to your hand.\n",

    "Ok, so if a particle is rotating around the $z$-axis, then we can use the above equation. But what if it is rotating around the $x$-axis or $y$-axis?

    "**Solution**\n",
    "    \n",
    "First find the moment of inertia of the sphere about an axis through its CM and along the z-axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2 = \\frac{(2)}{(5)}(5.0)(0.2)^2 = 0.08~\\textrm{kgm}^2 $$\n",

    "Then we apply the *Parallel Axis Theorem* to find the moment of inertia around the $z$-axis. We recognize that the distance between an axis through the CM and parallel to the $z$ axis and the $z$-axis is $D = 3.0$ m:\n",
