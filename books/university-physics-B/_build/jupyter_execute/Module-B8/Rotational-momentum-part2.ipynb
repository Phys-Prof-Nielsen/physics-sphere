    "\n",
    "$$ m(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnitude\n",

    "\n",
    "To simplify the discussion, let us consider consider the instant where the particle is located at a position with y = 0 and view it as a 2D figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"B8.4-fig3.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, the velocity is directed into the page (or screen) as indicated by the circle with a cross. Using the right-hand rule, the direction of the angular momentum is given by the green arrow (its magnitude is not to scale). **We notice that this angular momentum is different from the one determined when the motion was in the xy-plane with  = 0**. We can draw another schematic where the particle is on the opposite side of the circular motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"B8.4-fig4.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be evident by now that the angular momentum is constantly changing directions through its x- and y-components, while the z-component remains constant. This is what we refer to as **precession** of the angular momentum. \n",

    "The angular momentum depends on the choice of origin if we choose the vector $\\vec{r}$ to represent the position vector of the particle.

    "1. The vector $\\vec{r}$ in the cross product is the directed line segment from the point of interest to the position of the particle/object. It does not necessarily have to be the position vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The point of interest is sometimes explained as evaluating the angular momentum around a new origin. This does not have to be the case as an observer at a given origin is in principle free to evaluate the angular momentum around any given point. In most cases, the point of interest is the origin. The freedom to choose becomes essential in the disucssion of torque.\n",
