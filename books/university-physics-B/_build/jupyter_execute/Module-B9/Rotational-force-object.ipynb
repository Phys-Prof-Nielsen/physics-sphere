    "We have seen how forces acting on a point particle can give rise to a torque about a point, causing the particle to experience a change in its angular motion. In this case, the forces all act at the same location and thus have the same position vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, for the case of an extended objects, forces may act at different locations. For example, gravity may act at the center of the object, while friction acts at the edge of the object. Another example, take a yardstick and put on a table. If you apply horizontal force at the mid point, the yardstick will begin to move in a straight line: it accelerates in a linear direction. If you apply the same horizontal force at one end point, it will likely start to rotate: it accelerates in an angular direction. Same force, but different effects due to point of contact being different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The torque (or rotational force) depends on WHERE the force is applied**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our beloved point particle only posseses orbital angular motion whereas the extended object can possess both orbital and spin angular momentum. We will restrict our current discussion on the spin motion only.\n",
