    "The net force we discussed previously were responsible for producing a **linear** acceleration of a particle or an object. Therefore, it is sometimes referred to as **linear force**. The counterpart for causing a **rotational** (or angular) acceleration of a point particle or an object is known as the **torque** and is sometimes referred to as a **rotational force** \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "The force contributing to the torque itself is no different from the linear force. What is different is the effect. For example, take a yardstick and put on a table. If you apply horizontal force at the mid point, the yardstick will begin to move in a straight line: it accelerates in a linear direction. If you apply the same horizontal force at one end point, it will likely start to rotate: it accelerates in an angular direction. Same force, but different effects.\n",
