    "The net force we discussed previously were responsible for producing a **linear** acceleration of a particle or an object. Therefore, it is sometimes referred to as **linear force**. The counterpart for causing a **rotational** (or angular) acceleration of a point particle or an object is known as the **torque** and is sometimes referred to as a **rotational force** \n",

    "\n",
    "In the linear momentum case, we saw that momentum itself was not that interesting. Instead, it was the **change in momentum** that was of greater interest. Such a change required an interaction on the object in form of a **linear net force** and the change in linear momentum was calculated in form of the **impulse-momentum theorem**. Similarly, a change in **orbital rotational (angular) momentum** of a point particle requires a **net rotational force**. Such a rotational force is called **torque**.\n",
