    "This is the first note on integrals and will detail one approach to integrals: the antiderivative. This approach is most often used on analytical calculations and probably the approach we will use the most. We will not go into detail on how we properly define it, which is a task for your calculus course. Instead, we will illustrate through some examples how we can use it for our purpose. The second approach is to define the integral as an infinite sum and provide a more conceptual insight to the integral. This approach becomes very valuable when we will relate physical parameters in a conceptual way, and also very valuable as a numerical tool to integration. We will talk more about numerical approaches later in the course.\n",
