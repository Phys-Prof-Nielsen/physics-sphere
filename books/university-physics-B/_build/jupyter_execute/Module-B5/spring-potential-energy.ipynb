    "Springs are often encountered in physics problems, both in textbook problems but also in everyday life applications. In principle, anything that can stretch or compress can be modeled as a spring system. For example, a concrete pillar in a construction. More direct examples of spring system in everyday life are suspension systems in construction and vehicles.\n",

    "where $k$ is the **spring constant** and $x$ is the displacement stretched/compressed from the equilibrium state of the spring. The spring constant is a measure the amount of force required to stretch/compress the spring by 1 m. The spring force is always a **restoring force** in the sense that it always is directed towards the equilibrium state of the spring.\n",

    "Plenty of springs exists that do not obey Hooke's law. It is just that Hooke's law is relatively simple and many spring systems encountered do to a good approximation follow this law.\n",

    "From Hooke's law, it is quite evident that it is a conservative force. For example, if we strecth the spring by an amount $x$ to the right the spring force is directed to the left: negative work is done. If we then relax the spring back to its original position, the displacement is the left and the force remains to the left as well: positive work. We can also confirm it through the following integrals:\n",
