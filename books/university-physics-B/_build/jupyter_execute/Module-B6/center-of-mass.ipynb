    "\n",
    "We are now moving into the regime of investigating extended objects, that is, objects where size and shape may play a role. This is in contrast to the point particle concept. In doing so, explaining the dynamics quickly becomes complicated as we keep track of individual particles making up an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in many instances, we do not worry about the dynamics of each particle in an object but instead interested in the **collective** dynamics. The **center of mass** or **CM** is a key parameter to describe such collective behavior.\n",

    "\n",

    "## B6.1.3 Concept of Density\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of mass used for example in chemistry is not based on physical principles (physics arrogance shining bright). Instead, it is based on common sense approach: **a measure of how much matter there is in a substance** and does **not** apply to a point particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are lifting a bucket of rocks with a total mass of 12 kg and add a rock with a mass of 1.5 kg, then the total mass is 13.5 kg, common sense, right? Yes, for macroscopic and every objects this makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we are dealing with objects in the quantum realm such as atoms and nuclei, we find that it does not work that way. For example, consider a Helium consisting of 2 protons, 2 neutrons, and 2 electrons. If we add the individual masses of these particles, we do **not** get the total mass of the Helium atom. Instead, the Helium atom has slight less mass due to conversion of mass to energy to bind the nucleons together. This was realized by Albert Einstein in 1905 and made famous through his $E = mc^2$ equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of our class, we will deal with macroscopic objects and can take the common sense approach. In this approach, we will need to know how dense an object is, or its **mass density**. Depending on whether we are considering 1D, 2D, or 3D objects we can describe the mass through its mass density (linear, surface, volume) and its geometrical space (length, area, volume).\n",
