    "\n",
    "In Phases D and C we defined the work-energy theorem, but briefly mentioned that it can be derived from Newton's 2nd law. We are now ready to do so. It should be noted, that Newton's 2nd law could also be derived from the work-energy theorem. Which one is more fundamental is more of a philosophical question. To Newton, the interactions (forces) and the related change in motion was fundamental\n",
