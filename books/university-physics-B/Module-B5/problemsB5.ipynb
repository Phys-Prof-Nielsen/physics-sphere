    "Part one is straightforward since we are given the spring constant and the distance the spring is compressed. The second part requires a little bit more consideration. We can use our beloved work-energy theorem as we must include the work done by friction. If we let $x$ be the position along the surface away from equilibrium of the system, then the total distance friction does work is $x + 0.10$. That distance combined with the incline angle also allows us to evaluate the change in height to evaluate change in gravitational potential energy. A free-body diagram will allow us to find the frictional force. However, we have done this kind of problem multiple times by now and should know that the normal force is given by \n",

    "1. Since the horizontal surface is frictionless mechanical energy must be conserved for motion along it. From the spring potential energy we can then find the kinetic energy and the corresponding speed prior to compressing the spring. This is the speed anywhere on the horizontal surface and at the bottom of the incline. \n",
