  <p class="w3-center"><em>A Unique Path to Education and Family Fun</em></p>
  <p>Prof. Kim Nielsen is a remarkable individual whose journey through the world of physics, education, 
    and family life is as unique as it is inspiring.<br>
    <br>

Born with a sense of curiosity that knew no bounds, Kim embarked on his academic journey at Bikini Bottom University with dreams of 
    unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Despite graduating last in his class, his unwavering determination and love for 
    physics propelled him to earn a Ph.D. in the field.<br>
    <br>

Kim's academic journey took an unexpected turn when he founded the Physics Sphere, an innovative educational platform aimed at 
    providing free study materials to students. His vision was clear: to break down the barriers to education and ensure that 
    knowledge was accessible to all, regardless of their circumstances.<br>
    <br>

Beyond his educational endeavors, Kim has a multifaceted personality that enriches his life 
    and the lives of those around him. In his free time, he cherishes moments of solitude, seeking solace 
    in the quietude of nature to recharge his spirit.<br>
    <br>

A surprising twist in his interests is his love for binge-watching Korean dramas, a passion that takes him on emotional r
    ollercoasters and cultural journeys from the comfort of his own home. He also enjoys the art of procrastination 
    when it comes to learning the guitar, sometimes strumming a few chords in between episodes.<br>
    <br>

Kim's cultural curiosity extends to his interest in learning Japanese, where he delves into the intricacies of 
    language and culture, opening doors to new worlds of understanding.<br>
    <br>

While Kim may be the brains behind the educational mission of the Physics Sphere, his family life is a true testament 
    to his playful spirit. He shares his home with both human and "doggy" kids, a boisterous and loving bunch. 
    Kim fully embraces his role as a doggy parent, partaking in their favorite activities with enthusiasm. 
    Together, they enjoy the doggy kids' cherished pastimes of yelling at passersby and creating 
    chaos with backyard hole-digging escapades.<br>
    <br>

Prof. Kim Nielsen's journey is a testament to the unexpected and the beautiful fusion of education, entertainment, and family life. 
    He continues to inspire through his dedication to accessible education and reminds us all to cherish the joys of both learning and play.

 <p class="w3-center"><em>A non-AI Generated Biography</em></p>
  <p>I got my BS in physics from University of Copenhagen (I am Danish) before I decided to stepping into the wild as a 
    MS student of physics at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. After 4 years in the wild, I moved to Utah State University 
    where I received my PhD in physics. <br>
    <br>
    Hauling my way out of Utah, I went to Washington D.C., where I spent two years in my car on I-95 and occasionally worked at the Naval Research Laboratory developing <s>censored by DOD</s>. 
    One day, I took a different exit and ended up in Boulder, Colorado, where I enjoyed 3 years of research working on my own NSF projects and 
    the NASA Aeronomy of Ice (AIM) satellite mission (pretty exciting algorithm retrieval development).<br>
    <br>
    
    I always enjoyed teaching and combined with the stressful hustle of writing research grants, I decided to pursue my luck in higher education. 
    Back to Utah I went and have now been at UVU since 2012. <br>
    <br>

    Aside from teaching, I love researching waves in the near-space environment and cosmic rays, launching high-altitude balloons and high-powered amateur rockets. 
    Enjoyments that are not physics-related are spending time around my kid(s) and dogs, mountain biking, trail running, yoga, binge-watching korean dramas, brewing beer, DIY work around
    the house, trying to learn playing the guitar, learning japanese and explore japanese culture.
