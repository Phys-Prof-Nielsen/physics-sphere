    "The above measurements does not state the uncertainty explicitly but it is suggested by the significant figures used.\n",
    "For example, 8.15 cm has three significant figures (we will see the rules later) in the reported value. This measurement tells us that we are correct to the first two number (8.1 cm), while the third digit is uncertain.\n",
