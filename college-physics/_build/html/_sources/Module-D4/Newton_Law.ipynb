    "A particle of mass 0.5 kg is subject to a net average force according to $F_{x,net} = +80.0$ N. The particle is initially moving with a velocity of +2.0 m/s in the positive x-direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Methodology</b>:\n",
    "Using the force-acceleration version of Newton's 2nd law, we apply a plug and chuck approch to find the acceleration. From the acceleration, we can obtain the final velocity as we are given the elapsed time and the initial velocity. The speed is simply the magnitude of the velocity since we are restricted to 1D motion. The last question is a conceptual question as we cannot tell anything about the instantaneous acceleration with the information given.\n",

    "Using the definition of acceleration, we have\n",
    "        \n",
    "$$a_x = \\frac{\\Delta v_x}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{\\Delta t} $$\n",
    "        \n",
    "Solving for the final velocity (state 2 or event 2):\n",
    "        \n",
    "$$ v_{2x} = v_{1x} + a_x \\Delta t $$ \n",
    "        \n",
    "Now we insert our numbers and obtain:\n",
    "        $$ v_{2x} = (+2.0) + (160)(5) = +802~\\textrm{m/s} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Part (3)<br>\n",
    "Since we are moving in a straight line in 1D, the speed is simply the magnitude of the velocity:\n",
    "        \n",
    "$$ v = 802~\\textrm{m/s} $$\n",
    "    \n",

    "We would have to use calculus and have more information than given to say something about the instantaneous acceleration.\n",
